# Simple Care - Frontend

Simple Care is a task management tool for anyone who finds themself in a caregiver role, one who takes care of another person or loved one.
This [link](https://github.com/andydvalle/capstone-project-backend) will direct you to the backend repository.

## Motivation

In my previous experience in health care, often times I've noticed it is the patient's loved ones that are managing their care. They have to remember all the medications, health conditions, and health events that happens to the patient. Healthcare can be very complicated. Simlple Care was created to help caregivers manage the care of their loved one in a simple easy to use application.
